# CRM Feature Roadmap — Agency / Service Provider CRM

This document lists the features to implement in the CRM, ordered by priority.
The product is designed for an agency or IT service provider, with a strong
focus on client relationships, project delivery, and a read-only client portal.

A key product principle: **clients must be able to follow the progress of their
projects in a read-only client portal**, while internal teams retain full
editing and administration capabilities.

Marketing and communication tooling is **out of scope for this roadmap**: the
agency's existing communication products (social publishing, content calendar,
campaigns, email marketing sequences, communication reporting) will be
connected later through a modular integration layer instead of being built into
the CRM core.

---

## Priority levels

- **P0 — MVP / Core**: Required for a usable first release.
- **P1 — High**: Required shortly after the MVP to make the CRM operational for a real agency.
- **P2 — Medium**: Important for scale, automation, and better reporting.
- **P3 — Later / Differentiators**: Advanced features.

---

## Already shipped (as of 2026-10-14)

The CRM core is live; the data model is documented in
[ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-extend-clients-into-crm-core.md) and the code lives in
`apps/web/lib/crm/`, `apps/web/actions/crm.ts` and `apps/web/components/crm/`.

- **Users & access**: email/password authentication, organizations, roles
  (owner/admin/member/viewer), record owners, audit trail.
- **Companies & contacts**: search and filters, duplicate detection, CSV
  import/export, archive/restore, custom fields (text, number, date, select,
  multi-select, boolean, URL, email, phone).
- **Sales pipeline**: configurable pipelines and stages, kanban board with drag
  & drop, deal won/lost with loss reason, weighted forecast, per-page stats.
- **Activities**: notes, calls, emails and meetings merged with system events
  on per-record timelines.
- **Tasks** (project-scoped): assignees, priorities, labels, comments,
  subtasks, task templates.
- **Projects**: members, labels, start/due dates, budgeted hours, activity feed;
  linkable to a company from its CRM record (the project page links back to
  the company).
- **Files**: resumable upload protocol, versions, sharing, PostgreSQL
  large-object storage.
- **Documents on records**: link existing files to companies, contacts and
  deals from record pages (picker, unlink, internal/client visibility),
  history on the record timeline.
- **Notifications (in-app)**: header bell with unread count, read/unread
  state, triggers on task assignment, deal stage changes and deal won/lost,
  click-through to the related record.
- **Client portal**: portal accounts invited from a company record (admin
  creates an invitation and shares the link), a `client` organization role
  scoped to one company, read-only dashboard and project pages (progress,
  tasks, shared documents), shared discussion thread with the team, task
  detail (read-only) with comments, client document uploads and unread “new
  since last visit” badges; per-project **client access policies** (portal
  visibility, discussion and task comments: hidden / read / read & write)
  in the project settings; downloads go through a dedicated portal endpoint
  and internal workspace access is blocked for portal users.
- **HR**: time tracking (half-day entries allocated to projects), leave,
  capacity, payroll.
- **Assistant**: CRM data available to the AI assistant through MCP tools
  (OAuth2-protected endpoint).

## P0 — Remaining

### 1. Client portal — read-only project view (shipped)

Shipped: email/password portal accounts as restricted organization members
(the `client` role linked to one company), invited from the company record
(the admin shares the invitation link manually); dashboard with the
company's projects (progress, due dates) and its client-visible documents;
project page with status, progress, tasks/milestones and the **shared
discussion thread**; **task detail pages** (read-only: status, priority,
description, labels, checklist) with a **shared task comment thread**;
clients can **post messages** and **task comments** (the team is notified
in the header bell) and **upload documents** (max 25 MB, stored as workspace
files and linked to the company as client-visible documents); per-project
**client access policies** in the project settings — portal visibility,
discussion and task comments each set to **hidden / read-only / read &
write** (the internal task panel shows client comments with a “Client”
badge and internal authors can reply there); the team gets a **Discussion
tab** on the project page and unread “new since last visit” badges greet
the client; downloads are served by a dedicated portal endpoint that
enforces the client-visible link; portal users are redirected to `/portal`
and blocked from the internal workspace (pages, server actions, file API
and MCP).

Remaining:

- Per-activity visibility so internal project updates can be marked
  client-visible.
- Validation requests / approvals on specific deliverables.
- Email notifications and digests for clients (they currently rely on the
  “new since last visit” badges).
- Magic-link sign-in and multiple companies per portal user.

**Goal:** Improve transparency, reduce status-request emails, and build client
trust.

### 2. Documents connected to CRM records (partially shipped)

Shipped: linking existing files to companies, contacts and deals from record
pages (picker, unlink), internal vs client-visible flag per linked document,
audit + timeline events, MCP tools (`list_crm_documents`, `link_crm_document`,
`unlink_crm_document`).

Remaining:

- Upload directly from a CRM record (reuse the chunked upload protocol
  instead of switching to the Files module).
- Deliverable validation requests from the portal (with item 1).

**Goal:** Centralize contracts, specifications, invoices, designs, reports and
deliverables on the record they belong to.

### 3. Notifications (in-app shipped)

Shipped: in-app notifications with read/unread state and a header bell;
triggers on task assignment, deal stage changes and deal won/lost;
click-through navigation; mark one / mark all as read.

Remaining:

- Email transport and per-user notification preferences.
- Task due-date reminders (needs a scheduler).
- Mentions in comments and activity descriptions.
- Client portal activity notifications (with item 1).

**Goal:** Keep internal teams and clients informed without requiring them to
check the CRM constantly.

## Deferred — Communication and marketing tool integration

The agency's communication products will be connected **after** the CRM core
is stable, through a modular integration layer rather than inside the CRM:

- LinkedIn post planning and publishing, social media performance tracking,
  content calendar, campaign management, email marketing sequences.
- Communication reporting per client, lead attribution from campaigns,
  automatic creation of records from campaign interactions.

---

## Suggested order

1. **Global search** (item 16) — the route already exists as a placeholder.
2. **Dashboards** (item 4) — build on the existing stat computations.
3. **Quotes → invoicing → time tracking/profitability** (items 9 → 10 → 11).
