# Contributing to Asynchrone Space

Thanks for your interest in improving Asynchrone Space! This document explains how to set
up the project, make changes, and submit them.

By participating you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs or request features using our
  [issue templates](https://github.com/preskater/asynchrone/issues/new/choose).
- Improve docs (see the [documentation template](https://github.com/preskater/asynchrone/issues/new/choose)).
- Submit a pull request for an open issue. Issues labelled
  [`good first issue`](https://github.com/preskater/asynchrone/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/preskater/asynchrone/labels/help%20wanted)
  are great starting points.
- Review pull requests and join [discussions](https://github.com/preskater/asynchrone/discussions).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.9.0 (see `engines` in `package.json`).
- **npm** 11 (declared via `packageManager`; run `corepack enable` to match).
- **Docker** (recommended) for a local PostgreSQL instance, or your own
  PostgreSQL 18 server.

## Setup

1. **Fork and clone** the repository, then install dependencies from the repo
   root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start PostgreSQL.** The quickest option is Docker:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d postgres
   ```

   (If you already run PostgreSQL locally, skip this and point `DATABASE_URL`
   at it instead.)

3. **Configure environment variables.** Copy the example file and fill in the
   values:

   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   ```

   At minimum, set `DATABASE_URL` and a `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (any random
   string). An `OPENAI_API_KEY` is only needed for AI assistant features.

4. **Create the per-app databases, apply migrations and generate the Prisma
   clients:**

   ```bash
   npm run db:create
   npm run migrate:deploy
   npm run verify:migrations
   npm run generate --workspaces --if-present
   ```

   `db:create` creates `asynchrone_identity`, the seven domain databases and
   their shadow databases from the fixed map in
   `packages/migrate/src/databases.mjs`. Provide the `*_DATABASE_URL` keys (see
   `apps/web/.env.example`).

5. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The customer app is available at http://localhost:3000 and the control tower
   at http://localhost:3001.

## Project structure

This is a [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) monorepo managed with npm
workspaces.

## Scripts

workspaces.

Unit tests use `*.unit.test.ts` next to the code. There is no separate test
package; add a test beside the module you change.

## Making a change

1. Create a branch off `main` with a descriptive name, e.g.
   `feat/bulk-task-actions` or `fix/calendar-timezone`.
2. Make your change, keeping it focused, and follow the existing code style
   (see `.prettierrc` and `.eslintrc.js` / workspace `eslint.config.js` files).
3. Run the checks before pushing (CI runs the same order):

   ```bash
   npm run lint \
     && npm run check:boundaries \
     && npm run verify:prisma-schemas \
     && npm run typecheck \
     && npm run build
   ```

   Add the relevant `test:unit` workspaces when you touch runtime code.

4. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, …), matching the existing git
   history.
5. Open a pull request against `main` and fill out the template. Link the issue
   it addresses (e.g. `Closes #123`).

We aim to review pull requests within a few business days. `main` is protected:
changes land through pull requests once CI passes.
