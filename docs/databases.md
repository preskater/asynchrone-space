# Per-app databases

ADR 0032 gives every workspace app its own PostgreSQL database. The target
schemas are generated from the monolith schema by
`scripts/split-prisma-schema.mjs`; the data copy is #185 and the migration
orchestration is #184.

`@workspace/db-core` owns the shared pool factory and `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`
validation. `@workspace/db` remains the monolith database until #185.

Every package declares its own `DATABASE_URL` env:

- `IDENTITY_DATABASE_URL`
- `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL`
- `CALENDARS_DATABASE_URL`
- `FILES_DATABASE_URL`
- `MESSAGES_DATABASE_URL`
- `CLIENTS_DATABASE_URL`
- `EMPLOYEES_DATABASE_URL`
- `CONTROL_TOWER_DATABASE_URL`

All fall back to `DATABASE_URL` for local/CI convenience. Production sets each
explicitly (#192).

## Local development

`docker/postgres/init.sql` creates every database when the compose volume is
initialized:

```bash
docker compose up postgres
```

Existing volumes are not re-initialized. Create missing databases manually with
the same `CREATE DATABASE` statements or reset the volume.

## Generation

The schemas are generated, not hand-edited:

```bash
npm run split:prisma
npm run verify:prisma-schemas
```

`split-prisma-schema.mjs`:

1. reads `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`;
2. assigns every model to one database (auth models are duplicated for the
   control tower);
3. removes relation fields that point at another database, keeping the scalar
   `organizationId`/`userId` columns;
4. appends the shared `AuditLog` table to every database;
5. writes each package's `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma.config.ts`, client and
   package scaffold.

Change the ownership map or the source model, then regenerate. Do not edit a
generated schema by hand.

## Generate clients

```bash
npm run generate --workspace=@workspace/db-projects
# or through the Turbo graph:
npm run typecheck
```

Each package writes its client to `lib/generated/prisma`. The generated folders
are ignored by ESLint and git.

## Migrations

The monolith migrations still run first until #185. The per-app orchestrator then
applies every database in dependency order:

```bash
npm run db:create            # creates app + shadow databases when missing
npm run migrate:deploy       # identity → projects → … → control-tower
npm run migrate:status       # per-app Prisma status
npm run verify:migrations    # fails on drift between migrations and schema
```

`packages/migrate` owns the order and the env mapping. It requires every
`*_DATABASE_URL` in production; `--allow-database-url-fallback` exists only for
local/CI where every target lives on one server.

Shadow databases are derived by appending `_shadow` to the database name, or
set explicitly with `IDENTITY_SHADOW_DATABASE_URL`, … They are used by
`verify:migrations` and are created by `db:create`.

Each database currently has one `20261031120000_init` baseline. The Docker
`migrate` stage runs the monolith migration and then the orchestrator. The Helm
migrate Job reads every `*_DATABASE_URL` from the existing migrate secret.

## Boundaries

- A domain package imports only its own `@workspace/db-<domain>` package.
- No cross-database relation fields or joins. Cross-domain reads use the
  internal APIs from `@workspace/contracts` and `@workspace/service-auth`.
- No cross-database cascades. Organization/user deletion and export are sagas
  (#188).
- Every database has its own migration history; the monolith history is retired
  when #185 cuts the data over.
