# Keyboard-only pass of the core flows

Manual WCAG 2.2 AA check for issue #41. The automated axe spec (`apps/web/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`) covers what can be detected from the DOM. This pass covers what it cannot: whether each core flow can be completed with the keyboard alone, in English and in French.

## How to run it

Run each flow in `/en/...` and then in `/fr/...`. Do not touch the mouse or trackpad. Use only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Escape and the arrow keys.

On every step, check:

- **Focus visible**: you can always see where focus is.
- **Focus order**: Tab follows the visual order, and nothing focusable is invisible.
- **No trap**: you can always Tab away, and Escape closes dialogs, menus and popovers.
- **Focus return**: when a dialog closes, focus returns to the control that opened it.
- **Names**: every control is announced or labelled with its purpose. Icon-only buttons need a label.
- **Errors**: when a form is submitted empty, the error is announced and read again when you return to the field.

Record results as `OK`, `KO` (blocking) or `~` (works, with friction). Describe every `KO` and `~` in the Findings table.

## Findings

| ---- | ------ | ---- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
|      |        |      |         |          |           |

## Known gaps

These were found while preparing this pass and are not fixed on this branch:

- `apps/web/components/task/date-picker.tsx` has no `id`, so its label points to nothing and custom date fields on tasks cannot be linked to their error.
- Input borders (`--input`) are about 1.2:1 against the background in light themes and 1.5:1 in dark themes. WCAG 1.4.11 asks for 3:1 when the border is the only boundary of the field.
- In the default light theme the focus ring (`--ring`) is 2.6:1 for the solid border and 1.5:1 for the halo, below 3:1.
- Primary button text is 4.24:1 in the Ocean light theme and 4.43:1 in the Candy light theme, just below 4.5:1.
