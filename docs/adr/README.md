# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Asynchrone Space. Each
record captures one architecturally significant decision together with its
context, the options that were considered, and the consequences.

Records are written with the
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) template (Markdown Any Decision Records)
from the [architecture-decision-record](https://github.com/architecture-decision-record/architecture-decision-record)
collection.

## Conventions

- One decision per file, named `NNNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded, sequential).
- Status is one of `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, or `superseded by [ADR-XXXX](XXXX-....md)`.
- Records are immutable: to change a decision, add a new record that supersedes
  the old one rather than editing it. Additive updates are allowed with a dated
  note.
- Exception: product-name references in existing records were rewritten once
  during the rename to Asynchrone Space ([ADR 0020](0020-rename-to-asynchrone-space.md)).
  Those edits changed naming only, never the recorded decisions.
